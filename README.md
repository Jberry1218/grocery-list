# GroceryPlanner
## Description
GroceryPlanner allows users to build and save grocery lists and recipes to make the grocery shopping experience a less cumbersome process. On GroceryPlanner, a user's grocery list is a living document, so users do not need to continually add grocery staples to the list week after week. Users also have the ability to save their favorite recipes to GroceryPlanner. Once a recipe is saved, if a user knows that they plan on cooking that recipe, they can press a single button to add the recipe's ingredients to the shopping list. When a user is ready to head to the store, they can press the "Shopping Mode" button and check off items from the list as they are found. GroceryPlanner is a responsive, mobile-first application that can be easily utilized from a user's phone while they are shopping.
